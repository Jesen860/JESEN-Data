From one of the highest ridges in the Santa Cruz Mountains, park visitors enjoy hiking, backpacking, and horseback riding. Rock climbers explore the park’s caverns and rocks, including the namesake Castle Rock. Plant-lovers come for California black oaks, knobcone pines, and high-elevation coast redwoods. The park’s 34 miles of rugged trails conveniently connect to an extensive trail system that links the Santa Clara and San Lorenzo valleys to nearby Big Basin Redwoods State Park and open space preserves on the Skyline to the Sea Trail.",

Battery Wallace was built several years later, followed by Antiaircraft Battery No. 2 and Battery 129. What’s amazing is that all of the old bunkers, abandoned buildings and lookouts, and historic military fortifications are open to the public for free with trails and picnic areas to enjoy. While many structures are covered in graffiti on both the outside and inside, the main green Battery Mendell building was fairly clean on the outside with the majority of the graffiti visible only by peeking in the windows. Almost the entire first floor was gated, sealed, and closed to visitors, so we headed up one of the concrete staircases to the second floor, where we found another staircase that lead to a lookout tower, staircases to the cliff trails above the battery, and the huge circular emplacements for the giant guns.",

As part of its ‘Ask-a-Climber’ program, the Yosemite Climbing Association (www.yosemiteclimbing.org) sets up a telescope through which you can view climbers at El Capitan Bridge (12:30pm to 4:30pm mid-May to mid-October) and answers visitors’ questions.",

Panoramic Hwy climbs from Hwy 1 through the park, then winds downhill to Stinson Beach, a mellow seaside town. Park headquarters are at Pantoll Station, the nexus of many trails, with a wooded first-come, first-served campground. The park was formed in 1930, partly from land donated by congressman and naturalist William Kent (who, in 1907, also donated the land that became Muir Woods National Monument).",

Built to replace space shuttle Challenger, Endeavour was the final orbiter to join the shuttle fleet, Endeavour first launched on May 7, 1992 for mission STS-49. Another major mission for Endeavour was STS-61, the first service mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, which took place in December 1993. Endeavour’s final mission, in May 2011, delivered spare parts to the International Space Station. Endeavour leaves an amazing legacy in space—and shares part of that legacy with Los Angeles, California, and the world from right here at the California Science Center.",

Its design resembles that of a university, with the buildings arranged around green spaces, similar to a suburban business park.",

You'll be met by an army of Geniuses in red shirts offering information from how to use the latest Apple innovations (all in the showroom) to how to view the impressive new doughnut-shaped Apple headquarters by using an iPad and a space-age model of the campus (prepare to be impressed). There's also a cafe serving the same treats that Apple employees are offered at work, and a viewing area where you can get a glimpse of the entirely glass-fronted and perfectly round Apple headquarters. The building sits on 175 acres of old orchard land that still is maintained for fruit and drought resistant trees; 80% of the whole site remains green space. The entire space is powered with renewable energy and cost over $5 billion to build. It was completed in 2018.",

This vast expanse of shoreline is excellent for beachcombing. Walk in either direction for miles and rest by sitting on drift logs along the upper beach. Just remember that at the highest tides the beach can be all wet in some places. From December through April the beach south of the South Beach parking lot is closed for elephant seal mating season. During that time bring binoculars for spotting gray whales that are migrating around the point. This exposed west side of the peninsula has dangerous swimming conditions with strong rip currents, cold water temps, and sneaker waves. If you want a milder surf head to nearby Drakes Beach which is protected by the point. The South Beach parking lot is located just off Sir Francis Drake Boulevard on the way to the Point Reyes Lighthouse.",

This family-friendly trail is a great way to explore White Sands. Katie the Kit Fox, the Dune Life Nature Trail mascot, will join you along the trail in 14 trailside signs. Learn about the animals that live in the park and what they like to eat. The Dune Life Nature Trail is an ecotone: a place where two communities meet and integrate. In this area, the desert scrub community and the gypsum sand dunes meet and form one of the most diverse ecosystems in the park. While many animals live here, you may not see many of them on your hike. Wild animals are shy and try to avoid people, and most desert animals are nocturnal. Although they are rarely seen during the day, they leave signs of their presence in different forms, such as tracks in the sand. These tracks tell the stories of the previous night’s activities in the dunes. Look for the tracks of the animals that call these dunes home: kit foxes, badgers, birds, coyotes, rodents, and reptiles all live in this area.",

In this tiny part of west Texas, the foliage (brilliant reds, subtle yellows, and deep browns) contrasts dramatically with the flavor of the arid Chihuahuan desert that includes century plants, prickly pear cacti, blacktail rattlers, steep canyon walls and crystal clear blue skies. Whether you come for the fall show, or plan your trip for another season, the beauty of McKittrick Canyon is always breathtaking.",

    "introduction": "Nearly a mile across and 600ft deep, the second-most impressive hole in Arizona was formed by a fiery meteor that screamed into the atmosphere about 50,000 years ago, when giant sloths lived in these parts. Meteor Crater, 40 miles east of Flagstaff, is an out-of-this-world site for those with a thimbleful of imagination. There are lookout points around the crater’s edge (but no hiking to the bottom) and the visitor center is as fun as it is informative.",

    "introduction": "New Mexico’s newest national monument consists of several separate components, totaling almost 500,000 acres and all lying within a 50-mile radius of Las Cruces. While much of it is not developed for visitors, the Organ Mountains, which rise to 9000ft east of the city, are definitely worth exploring. Several trails leave from the Dripping Springs Visitor Center, including the lovely Dripping Springs trail itself, a 3-mile round trip that passes the century-old remains of a sanatorium and a hotel. On the back (east) side of the range are two more trails, as well as the only campground in the area, Aguirre Spring. Other parts of the monument include the Desert Peaks segment, encompassing the Doña Ana Mountains, across the river northeast of Las Cruces and the site of some great mountain-bike trails, and the Robledo Mountains and the Sierra de las Uvas, stretching northwest along the western edge of the Rio Grande Valley as far as Hatch. The tiny Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, created in 2009 to protect a treasure trove of dinosaur footprints, is also part of the monument but not at all geared up for casual sightseers. Finally, the monument also includes the Potrillo Mountains, an expanse of cinder cones and volcanic craters scattered through the desert southwest of Las Cruces.",

    "introduction": "A Civil War-era fortress tucked near the southern anchorage of the Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Point was originally slated to be removed in the original Bridge plans. An attempt in 1926 to preserve the fort by the American Institute of Architects failed to gain traction, but Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss recognized its historic value. “While the old fort has no military value now,” Strauss wrote, “it remains nevertheless a fine example of the mason’s art… it should be preserved and restored as a national monument.” In response to this challenge, Strauss’ engineers fashioned a massive steel arch that supported the roadway while preserving the fort. This design element—a graceful arc in elegant juxtaposition to the angular brick structure below—saved Fort Point, which would be named a National Historic Site by Richard Nixon on October 16, 1970.",

   "introduction": "Few cities boast a structure so iconic as the Golden Gate Bridge, commemorated in everything from films like The Maltese Falcon to not one but two emojis. Still, it’s become so much a part of San Francisco’s fabric and the popular imagination that it’s easy to forget what an uphill battle it was to even break ground on the bridge. The decades long battle for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge included nay-saying over logistical challenges presented by the depth of the bay, the hard winds that come in off the Pacific, and even protected sites like Fort Point. The project also had such fierce opponents as the Southern Pacific Railroad Company’s ferry subsidiaries, the United States Navy, and even teamsters advocating for local labor, all who had a vested interest in prevent a bridge from ever crossing the San Francisco Bay.",

Because of its location, fishermen and fisherladies may encounter any species that enters the bay. It’s a great spot for fishing and crabbing. No license required. The pier is the original site where ships loaded underwater mines, then called “torpedoes,” before transporting and planting them outside the Golden Gate in the 1890s.",
